  bio: [
    "I'm a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, currently working on Prime Video Payments. I build and maintain reliable, scalable systems that support regional expansion and high availability of payment options, ensuring a smooth binge-watching experience for millions.",
    
    "Previously, I interned at Amazon on the same team, where I led the design and rollout of a critical fault-injection framework across 5+ microservices, improving resilience testing significantly. I also authored low-level designs and implemented features directly in production pipelines.",
    
    "I’ve done research in NLP and ML at the University of Tartu, where I explored multi-modal meme understanding using models like BERT, CLIP, and ViLBERT. I’ve published papers, presented at international venues, and co-authored open-source codebases.",
    
    "I graduated from IIT Ropar, where I led development on multiple projects, mentored 100+ students as a teaching assistant, and participated in hackathons. I'm passionate about system design, distributed systems, and building real-world AI tools.",
    
    "Driven by curiosity and a constant urge to build, learn, and share.",
    
    "जिज्ञासा परायणः\nOne who is devoted to or driven by curiosity."
